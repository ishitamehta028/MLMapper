MESSENGER (Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging) was a NASA spacecraft that orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015. Among its accomplishments, it determined Mercuryâ€™s surface composition, revealed its geological history and discovered details about its internal magnetic field.

While the albedo maps of Mercury are of high quality, the element maps are not. The highly elliptical orbit of MESSENGER in combination with the low-resolution instruments used has resulted in maps with missing data and spatial resolution that varies depending on the latitude.
